## How it works

The project takes one 8-bit input. the 8-bit input is split to form two 4-bit inputs. The inputs are put into an array that uses a combination of AND gates and Full Adders to get the individual values of the product.


## How to test

Give an 8-bit input and check if the output is the correct product of the first and last 4-bits of the input.
